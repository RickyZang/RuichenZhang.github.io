I am pursuing my Ph.D. degree with the [School of Electronic and Information Engineering] (http://eie.bjtu.edu.cn/), Beijing Jiaotong University, China, since Sep/2020. My supervisor is Prof. [Jiayi Zhang](https://sites.google.com/site/jiayizhang8650/). Since Nov/2023, I have been a visiting Ph.D. student at the School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. The supervisor during my visiting time at Nanyang Technological University is Prof. [Dusit Niyato](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/dniyato/).

My research primarily focuses on next-generation MIMO technology, including **extremely large-scale MIMO (XL-MIMO)** and **cell-free massive MIMO (CF mMIMO)**. Our key objective is to explore <font color=red>"performance analysis and efficient design for next-generation MIMO systems"</font>. If you are interested in our work, you can refer to this [repository](https://github.com/BJTU-MIMO) and WeChat official account (ID: BJTU MIMO) for the latest updates of our group!

If you have any questions or have an interest in collaborating with me, please feel free to email me (zhewang_77@bjtu.edu.cn)!
