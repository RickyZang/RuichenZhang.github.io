**Abstract**: In this paper, we investigate a cell-free massive MIMO system with both access points (APs) and user equipments (UEs) equipped with multiple antennas over jointly-correlated Rayleigh fading channels. We study four uplink implementations, from fully centralized processing to fully distributed processing, and derive their achievable spectral efficiency (SE) expressions with minimum mean-squared
error successive interference cancellation (MMSE-SIC) detectors and arbitrary combining schemes. Furthermore, the global and local MMSE combining schemes are derived based on full
and local channel state information (CSI) obtained under pilot contamination, which can maximize the achievable SE for the fully centralized and distributed implementation, respectively.
We study a two-layer decoding implementation with an arbitrary combining scheme in the first layer and optimal large-scale fading decoding (LSFD) in the second layer. Besides, we compute novel closed-form SE expressions for the two-layer decoding implementation with maximum ratio (MR) combining. In the numerical results, we compare the SE performance for different implementation levels, combining schemes, and channel models. It is important to note that increasing the number of antennas per UE may degrade the SE performance.
